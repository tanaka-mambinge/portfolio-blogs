# Why AI Chat \{Hasn’t Taken Off} and How to \{Improve It}

AI chat applications have been around for a while, yet their adoption hasn't been as widespread as we might expect. Despite advances in AI and machine learning, [many users](https://x.com/sh_reya/status/1838243034057875736) still find themselves frustrated by the limitations and complexities of AI chat interfaces. Here's why I believe AI chat hasn’t taken off and how we can design AI-powered apps that meet user expectations more effectively.

## Designing AI-Powered Apps: \{Why Commands} are Better Than Chat

When designing an AI-powered app, it’s more effective to use commands rather than relying solely on a chat interface. The problem with a plain chat interface is that users don't know what the AI can do. They are often presented with a blank slate and expected to interact with it as though they fully understand its capabilities. This assumption—expecting users to just "figure it out"—is a mistake.

Example chat interface

## The User \{Doesn’t Know} What the AI Can Do

Users want to accomplish tasks efficiently, not explore an AI’s capabilities through conversation. Without clear guidance, interacting with an AI can feel like navigating an API without documentation, not sure about which endpoints to query or what parameters to use. By implementing intuitive interfaces, such as buttons or simple commands, we can mask this complexity and guide users towards achieving their goals.

To meet user expectations, AI systems must offer clear, predictable actions that deliver specific outcomes. If an app doesn’t work as expected on the first try, users will likely abandon it. Command-based interfaces and structured inputs allow AI systems to focus on delivering value quickly, helping users get things done without the frustrations of exploratory conversations. This approach leads to more intuitive, actionable, and user-friendly AI applications.

## People Want To \{Get Things Done}, Not Chat

Despite advances in natural language processing, people often prefer direct interactions with AI systems over conversational ones. Users are task-oriented, seeking clear answers to direct commands rather than the ambiguity of chat-like exchanges. This shifts the focus of AI design from engagement to efficiency, as people want to accomplish tasks quickly and easily without unnecessary back-and-forth interactions.

Command-based systems offer a solution by providing clear, predictable interactions. When users issue a command like `/search`, `/ask`, `/recommend`, they know what to expect, and the AI can respond precisely, reducing confusion. This structured approach, as seen in platforms like WhatsApp and Telegram, enhances the user experience by guiding them towards their goals without the complexities of a freeform chat interface.

## Beyond Answers: Turning RAG into \{Actionable Outcomes}

AI systems should go beyond just providing answers to questions. Leveraging RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) to deliver actionable outcomes like feedback, reports, summaries, and other insights that help users to make informed decisions. For example, rather than simply answering “How many sales did we make last week?”, a business-focused AI system could generate a comprehensive report that includes trends, insights, and actionable recommendations to improve sales performance. The reports aren't freeform but use the organization's templates, styles, and structures to deliver results that they can act on.
